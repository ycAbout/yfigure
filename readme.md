## Why
There are plenty figure libraries, but yfigure aims to provide the simplest but very powerful and flexible way to draw a figure.
I build this library for myself, but I feel it may has the potential to benefit others, given that most figure libraries are pretty hard to use.


## How to use
Please vist the docs on the website: https://y-figure.web.app/
